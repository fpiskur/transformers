## How to use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Notes

Even though the app is sending requests to a fake server, the state in the app updates as if it was communicating to a real server. Everything works as if it was a real server except for editing newly added transformers (and it won't work out-of-the-box with a real server because of that).

The code is a bit hacky, but I was learning along the way and refactoring would take even more time. The design is very minimal but I tried to give it a nice user experience. My focus was more on functionality and trying to learn React so I used some basic Bootstrap classes for styling.
